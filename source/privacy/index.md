> Bookmarks Topic 工具隐私政策，详细说明数据处理、权限、安全、合规等，保障用户隐私安全。

1. Design Philosophy
--------------------

*   **Privacy First:** This tool is designed with a "privacy first" principle. All features are built to protect user data security and privacy as the highest standard.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** Only the minimum browser permissions required for core functionality are requested. No excessive or unrelated permissions are ever obtained.

2. Data Processing Principles
-----------------------------

*   **Local Processing:** All data processing, analysis, and display are performed locally in the user's browser environment. No user data is ever uploaded to any remote server or cloud.
*   **No Data Upload:** Neither input, output, nor intermediate data is collected, stored, or transmitted to the developer or any third party.
*   **No Logging:** The tool does not record user operation logs, input content, or usage behavior either locally or remotely.

3. Permissions Statement
------------------------

*   The tool only requests the minimum permissions necessary for core features. For example, some features may require "read current tab content" or "local storage" permissions, but will never access or modify unrelated data.
*   All permission requests strictly comply with the extension security specifications of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other mainstream browsers.
*   Users can view and manage granted permissions at any time in the browser extension management page.

4. Third-Party Dependencies & External Services
-----------------------------------------------

*   This tool does not integrate any third-party ad SDKs, analytics, or tracking code.
*   If third-party open source libraries (such as code highlighting, formatting, etc.) are used, all processing is done locally and no user data is sent to third parties.
*   If any external API is called, it is only for obtaining public information and never uploads or transmits user input.

5. Data Security Measures
-------------------------

*   All user data is stored only in the local browser cache (such as localStorage, IndexedDB, chrome.storage.local, etc.) and never leaves the user's device.
*   The tool does not include remote logging, cloud sync, or automatic backup features, eliminating the risk of data leakage.
*   No ads, no push notifications, no behavioral analytics, ensuring a pure and safe user experience.

6. User Rights & Control
------------------------

*   Users can manually clear all local cache data at any time in the tool interface.
*   Users can uninstall the tool at any time via the browser extension management page, and all local data will become invalid automatically.
*   The tool does not set any non-removable local storage or tracking mechanisms.

7. Compliance Statement
-----------------------

*   This tool strictly complies with major international data privacy regulations such as GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California).
*   The tool does not collect, process, or store any personal sensitive information (such as name, email, contact information, IP address, location, etc.).
*   All users, including minors, can use the tool safely without privacy concerns.
*   If browser policies or regulations are updated, the tool will be adjusted in a timely manner to ensure compliance.

8. Privacy Policy Updates
-------------------------

*   If there are major changes to this privacy policy, we will announce them promptly on the official website.
*   Users are advised to check this page regularly for the latest policy updates.
